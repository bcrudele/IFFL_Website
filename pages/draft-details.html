            <p class="news-info"></p>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">There are officially less than <b>1 month</b> until drafting day! This quick post should provided some more insight on how draft day should progress.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">This season welcomes 9+ new players to the league! The <b>Illinois Street Hockey League (ISHL)</b> has been around for more than 6 years, but we have little record-keeping to show for it.
            Roughly each year was a new season. As new problems emerged in the past, as a league we remained
            flexible. With more options and assistance at the league's disposal, this will be our most comfortable and professional season to date!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
            The biggest problem in the league's past-time was player availability. The introduction of many passionate players allows me to believe we are set for a great summer. 
            This was made especially made possible by Recruiting Lead and Algonquin Assassins General Manager, Anthony Woodcock. Thank you, Anthony!
            Creating a balanced draft is the last piece of the puzzle before the season can officially begin. Here is what the plan is as of now:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Draft Date: June 14th</li>
                <li>7:30 pm: Draft Lottery (only team captains)</li>
                <li>7:30 pm  - 7:45 pm: Captains continue working on their picks according to the lottery</li>
                <li>7:45 pm: Arrive in professional attire - pictures <i>may</i> be taken</li>
                <li>7:45 pm - 8:30 pm: Eat food and talk with potential team-mates</li>
                <li>8:30 pm - 9:00 pm: Draft sequence, 2-3 minutes between each draft pick</li>
                <li>9:00 pm: End of draft; encouraged to eat, chat, and group up with your new team</li>
                <li>Draft will be held mostly outdoors</li>
                <li>Players who cannot attend may join Online</li>
                <li>Skills competition or a draft combine may be created at a future date to show captains the potential of each player</li>
                <!-- <li>Location currently set for: 1315 Gaslight Dr. Algonquin, IL (CJ's house, may be subject to change)</li> -->
                <li>~5 Rounds</li>
                <li>4 Picks per Round</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
