            <p class="news-info">Author: Anthony Woodcock</p>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">As we are approaching the Summer of 2024, the ISHL draft is coming up fast. This will be the first of two rankings lists with the next coming between June 10th
              - June 13th. Please take all rankings and explanations with a grain of salt. This is in no way meant to be offensive to any player's skill at the sport, 
              it is simply a fun ranking of the players we have at hand. The captains have agreed on this ranking as we have discussed it with quite a bit of depth and detail. 
            </p>
           <br>
           <p style="text-align: left;">Ranks 1 through 10 will be shown in this article. If you are not in the top 10 you can request it privately, but just remember, these ranks will change after we have 
            seen everyone attend a day at the rink. For those of you in the top 10 selection, we expected great hockey from you all. On the contrary, for those not, we can’t wait 
            to see the plays and potential that we may have missed in these rankings. We want to be proved wrong and see great growth from everyone.
         </p>
          <br>
            <ol>
              <li style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>Colin Young</u></li>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Colin Young is the definition of elite in the ISHL. With the dimensions of his game being almost flawless, it is no wonder he finds himself atop this ranking. With incredible shooting, deking, and passing skills he has proven time and time again that he is that franchise guy that every captain wants. He also has incredible speed as well as a better than average two way game to back up his stick skills. It would be a massive surprise to see anyone other than Young go 1st overall in the 2024 ISHL draft.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Offense: 10/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Defense: 9.6/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Overall: 9.8/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Professional Player Comparison: Connor McDavid</i></p>

              <li style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>Jared Petrin</u></li>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Jared Petrin is the best two way player you could ask for. Although he may not have the speed that Young has, he makes up for it with his unmatched defensive awareness. Very rarely will a man clearly beat Petrin to a puck and almost all puck battles will end up on Petrin’s stick. To complement this he has a lethal shot in both power and accuracy as well as a great passing ability to go along with it.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Offense: 9.5/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Defense: 10/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Overall: 9.7/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Professional Player Comparison: Cale Makar</i></p>

              <li style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>Teddy Bittman</u></li>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Teddy Bittman is the best sniper in this draft. He has a lethal wrist shot that is almost impossible for goalies to save and that can be lethal from any angle. Bittman is also an incredibly strong skater and is very hard to bump off the puck. He can also play a two way game allowing for him to both create and execute on plays on both ends of the ice.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Offense: 9.9/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Defense: 9.3/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Overall: 9.5/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Professional Player Comparison: Patrick Kane</i></p>


              <li style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>Cody Christensen</u></li>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Christensen is a rookie in ISHL this year, and for some a rookie being this high may be a bit of a questionable choice. But his hockey skills prove the question marks wrong in a heartbeat. Cody has incredible shooting, puck movement, as well as can play a very good defensive game when needed. In addition, he is an incredible skater, with probably some of the best edgework in the entire draft. Watching Christensen this summer will truly be a treat for all and multiple captains have expressed they like him as a dark horse to win the league MVP.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Offense: 9.5/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Defense: 9.1/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Overall: 9.3/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Professional Player Comparison: Nikita Kuchertov</i></p>

              <li style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>John Leask</u></li>
              <p style="text-align: left;">John Leask is a bit of a wild card. At the time of this article being written, only one captain has seen him play at the ODR. However, that one sample put on quite the impression. He showed incredible control with and without the puck, as well as a sneaky fast and accurate shot. He has a solid passing game as well as can make plays happen that others would not be able to. Leask is another rookie in the ISHL and will also be incredibly helpful to whichever team he ends up on.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Offense: 9.6/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Defense: 9.0/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Overall: 9.3/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Professional Player Comparison: Jack Hughes</i></p>

              <li style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>Graham Holmes</u></li>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Holmes has proven time and time againthat he can make a difference on the rink. He has some of the best hands in all of ISHL as well as a lethal shot to back it up. Graham is also a great skater and has a good two way game as many of these top players in this draft do. He will be an excellent, most likely 2nd round pick that will pair up brilliantly with one of the top 3 guys.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Offense: 9.1/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Defense: 9.1/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Overall: 9.1/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Professional Player Comparison: Roman Josi</i></p>

              <li style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>Keegan Olivera</u></li>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Just as Christensen and Leask are, Olivera falls into the class of ISHL rookies this summer. Not all the captains have seen Olivera play much over the years, but from what the captains know, he is a great skater as well as shooter. His two way game is a bit of a question mark, and come the second ranking, his spot will hopefully be a lot better defined.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Offense: 9.1/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Defense: 8.9/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Overall: 9.0/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Professional Player Comparison: Artemi Panarin</i></p>

              <li style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>"Tuna" Matich</u></li>
              <p style="text-align: left;">What is there not to love about a player like Tuna. Maybe the only thing not to like would be having to play against him. He has an exceptional shot as well as a very good skater. Tuna is also the most vocal guy on the rink and can really hype up and rally your team. No matter what team he plays for he will be an awesome teammate to those around him and is always gonna hype others around him up.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Offense: 9.2/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Defense: 8.6/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Overall: 8.9/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Professional Player Comparison: Alexander Ovechkin</i></p>

              <li style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>Sean Mau</u></li>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Sean is an excellent defenseman who can also play a sneaky solid offensive game when given space. He is a good skater and passer, as well as can make big plays happen. Mau is someone who will be willing to get in front of any shot and always put his body on the line. Sean is also the most likely player to play the body in the league as well as having an upside of playing goaltender if needed. He is the perfect middle of the draft all around player that I could definitely see jumping a few spots depending on the team.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Offense: 8.4/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Defense: 9.2/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Overall: 8.8/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Professional Player Comparison: Victor Hedman</i></p>

              <li style="font-size: xx-large;"><u>Tyler Wibbler</u></li>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Tyler Wibbeler is decently new to hockey as he only started playing at the ODR last year. However, the improvement from him over that year has landed him here at the bottom of this top 10. To some, his decision to play defense this year was a bit of a surprise, but I am still confident that he can be an excellent mid round pick. He has good puck movement, a decent shot, as well as has become one of the faster skaters at the ODR.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Offense: 8.4/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Defense: 8.8/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Overall: 8.6/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Professional Player Comparison: Miro Heiskanen</i></p>

              <li style="font-size: xx-large; animation: wheel 2s infinite;"><u>Honorable Mention: Shey Sullivan</u></li>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Shey is the biggest wild card in the draft at this point. What we know as the captains is literally almost nothing. The only thing we have been told is that he has raced inline skating in the past and is somewhat new to hockey. He has the potential to be an incredible steal in the draft but it is too early to give him a defined ranking at this point.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Offense: ?/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Defense: ?/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Overall: ?/10</i></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Professional Player Comparison: Dylan Larkin</i></p>
